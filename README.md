# Smile Wuji's random stuff collection.

This repo contains some random (but independent) stuff taken from some of my 
projects. Feel free to grab any part of the code (remember to change the package
identifier); they are (going to be) MIT licensed.

If there's a bug or if there's a suggestion to my implementation, please file a
GitHub issue in this repo! I will be glad to fix my mistake since my projects 
would likely have the same issue!

# aug

This package contains an augmented AVL tree, and an example data type (TreeList) 
that uses the augmented structure.

The tree list is slightly better than LinkedList and ArrayList under the case 
that item-appending and random-removal are the only required operation.


# jsonflo

This package contains a light-weight JSON parser (serializer + deserializer)
which intends to work well with non-blocking IO. The idea is to parse data in a
promising way.
